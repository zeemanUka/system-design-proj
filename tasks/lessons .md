# Lessons Learned

## 2026-02-27 - Avoid Basic Visual Delivery
- Correction pattern: user asked for a more interactive and appealing UI after seeing a basic implementation.
- Prevention rule: for frontend requests, define a clear visual system first (typography, color tokens, cards, buttons, motion) before editing individual pages.
- Prevention rule: always include a purposeful landing page when the product targets new users and onboarding flow starts from `/`.
